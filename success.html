            <h2>Tips for being a Successful Student</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Get Organized.</b> <br> Making a plan for what you're going to do and when you're going to do it will make sure
                you're always ahead of the curve - literally. <br>

                <b>Don't multitask.</b> <br> Studies have shown that multitasking is physically impossible. <br>

                <b>Divide it up.</b> <br> Studying isn't fun to begin with, and forcing yourself through a study marathon will only
                make it worse. Dividing your work into manageable chunks and rewarding yourself when you finish each
                chunk will make studying (more) fun. <br>

                <b>Sleep.</b> <br> Don't underestimate the importance of those eight hours of zzz's every night! Getting a good
                night's rest will sharpen your focus and improve your working memory. <br>

                <b>Set a schedule.</b> <br> Do you work better right after school or after you've eaten dinner? Are you more
                productive in 90-minute blocks or half-hour spurts? Find a schedule that works for you, and stick to it. <br>

                <b>Take notes.</b> <br> Taking notes will not only keep you more engaged during class, but will also help you narrow
                down what you need to study when exam time rolls around. It's much easier to reread your notes than to
                reread your entire textbook! <br>

                <b>Study.</b> <br> This one might be obvious, but did you know that there's a right and a wrong way to study? Review
                your material several days ahead of time, in small chunks, and in different manners (for example, write
                flashcards one day and take practice tests the next). In other words, don't cram. <br>

                <b>Manage your study space.</b> <br> Find a place that will maximize your productivity. Look for places away from
                the television and other distractions. Whether it's your local library or just the desk in your bedroom,
                set aside a study space that you'll want to spend time in. <br>

                <b>Find a study group.</b> <br> Sitting down with a group of people who are learning the same things as you is a
                great way to go over confusing class material or prepare for a big test. You can quiz each other,
                reteach material, and make sure that everyone is on the same page. After all, teaching someone else is
                the best way to learn. <br>

                <b>Ask questions.</b> <br> You're in school to learn, so don't be afraid to do just that! Asking for help - from a
                teacher, a tutor or your friends - is a surefire way to make sure you truly understand the material.
